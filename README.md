# ERP 365Trip

## Project Overview
ERP 365Trip is a web-based application that combines a backend powered by Node.js and MongoDB, with a frontend served via Nginx. This application serves as a comprehensive tool for managing various operations in the 365Trip environment, allowing users to interact through a modern interface.

## Installation

To install and run the ERP 365Trip project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Install Docker**: Ensure that you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

3. **Build and run the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

The above command will build the necessary Docker containers and start up the application. The backend will be available on port `3000`, the frontend on port `8000`, and the MongoDB database on port `27017`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it via:
- Frontend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- Mongo Express (to manage your MongoDB instance): [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

Please ensure you have the appropriate credentials for the MongoDB instance:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

## Features
- **Backend Service**: Handles API requests, authentication, and data management.
- **Frontend Service**: Provides a modern user interface for end-users to interact with the application.
- **MongoDB**: A document-based database optimized for data storage and retrieval.
- **Mongo Express**: A web-based MongoDB admin interface for easy management of the database.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Easily deployable using Docker, ensuring a consistent development and production environment.

## Dependencies
The project uses the following services as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`:
- Node.js (for the backend)
- MongoDB (database)
- Nginx (for serving the frontend)
- Mongo Express (for managing the MongoDB database)

## Project Structure
The project has the following structure:
```
.
├── backend             # Contains backend service code
├── frontend            # Contains frontend service code
├── docker-compose.yml  # Docker Compose configuration file
```

Each directory (`backend` and `frontend`) should have its own respective code and configuration files for their specific platforms.
